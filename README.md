# How to Create POST Request Using ADF Copy Activity

## Prerequisites 
* For this tutorial, I'm using JsonPlaceHolder public API, please review it here  https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ 
and read carefully the **PUT**	request.
* We want to update this post https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1 , we are going to change the title into "Fun with ADF" like so : 
 
```
{
  "userId": 1,
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Fun With ADF",
  "body": "quia et suscipit\nsuscipit recusandae consequuntur expedita et cum\nreprehenderit molestiae ut ut quas totam\nnostrum rerum est autem sunt rem eveniet architecto"
} 
```
this is going to be our source **dataset** that we will send to the RestAPI endpoint. 
## Building Pipeline:

1. create a pipeline in ADF like so:
